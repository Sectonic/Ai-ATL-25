In underserved communities like Pittsburgh and English Avenue, the Community Land Trust initiative proved highly effective at reducing vacancy and creating stable housing. In gentrifying areas like Reynoldstown and West End, tax incentives spurred mixed-income development but also intensified concerns about rising costs. Affluent, low-density neighborhoods like Tuxedo Park and Brandon mounted significant legal and political resistance to upzoning, limiting its immediate impact. Meanwhile, targeted transit improvements in areas like Campbellton Road provided direct benefits to existing residents."
